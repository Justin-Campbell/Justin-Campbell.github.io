Prior to joining the MD/PhD program, I worked with [Anthony Hudetz](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=wT1blUcAAAAJ) and [Zirui Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=vq5REi4AAAAJ) in the [Center for Consciousness Science](https://consciousness.med.umich.edu) within the University of Michigan. While there, I leveraged computational techniques like deep learning to determine the patterns of functional connectivity in the brain across different states of consciousness. Together, we [developed a model](https://justin-campbell.github.io/files/Publications/2020-Campbell-Hudetz.pdf) that could accurately detect the state of consciousness in patients under anesthesia and those with a disorder of consciousness.

## Details coming soon!
