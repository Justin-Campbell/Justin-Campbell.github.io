Welcome! I'm an MD/PhD Student at the University of Utah School of Medicine. At present,
I am working on a PhD in Neuroscience with [John Rolston](https://www.rolstonlab.com)
and [Cory Inman](http://inman-lab.com/) within the
[Department of Neurosurgery](https://medicine.utah.edu/neurosurgery/) In the lab, I study the
brain electophysiology and behavior of patients undergoing neurosurgery in order to
understand how information is processed in the brain and to facilitate the development of
 neuromodulatory therapies.

Prior to medical school, I worked with [Anthony Hudetz and Zirui Huang](https://hudetzlab.med.umich.edu) in the
[Center for Consciousness Science](https://consciousness.med.umich.edu) within the University of Michigan.
While there, I leveraged computational techniques like deep learning to determine the patterns of functional
connectivity in the brain across different states of consciousness. Together, we
[developed a model](https://justin-campbell.github.io/files/Publications/2020-Campbell-Hudetz.pdf)
that could accurately detect the state of consciousness in patients under anesthesia and those with a disorder of
consciousness.
