Welcome! I'm an MD/PhD Student at the University of Utah School of Medicine. Lately, I've been working on a PhD in Neuroscience with [John Rolston](https://www.rolstonlab.com) and [Cory Inman](http://inman-lab.com/) within the [Department of Neurosurgery](https://medicine.utah.edu/neurosurgery/). In the lab, **I study intracranial electrophysiology and cognition in patients undergoing neurosurgery** using tools from the fields of cognitive and computational neuroscience. Our research helps us to better understand how information is processed in the brain, how neuromodulation changes the structure of the brain, and also facilitates the development of neuromodulatory therapies.
