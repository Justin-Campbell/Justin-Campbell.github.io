I'm an MD/PhD candidate at the University of Utah School of Medicine. My dissertation research leveraged intracranial EEG in humans to investigate multiscale neural dynamics evoked by direct electrical stimulation. I am particularly interested in leveraging advances in neurotechnology to design circuit-based, closed-loop therapies for individuals with treatment-resistant neuropsychiatric disease.
