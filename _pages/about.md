I'm an MD/PhD candidate at the University of Utah School of Medicine. My research leverages **intracranial electrophysiology**, **cognitive neuroscience**,and **neural engineering** to study how theta burst stimulation of the basolateral amygdala modulates activity in the medial temporal lobe at the level of individual neurons and distributed brain networks. I am particularly interested in leveraging advances in neurotechnology to design circuit-based, closed-loop therapies for individuals with treatment-resistant neuropsychiatric disease.
