I'm an MD/PhD student at the University of Utah School of Medicine working with [Cory Inman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=y07SI5oAAAAJ). In the lab, **I am developing closed-loop stimulation of the amygdala to enhance memory**.

Our approach leverages **intracranial electrophysiology, cognitive neuroscience, neural engineering,** and **computational modeling** to study the dynamics of memory at the level of single neurons and distributed networks. This research helps us to better understand how information is processed in the brain, how neuromodulation changes the way the brain is wired, and how we can leverage these insights to better treat patients with memory impairment.
