I'm an MD/PhD student at the University of Utah School of Medicine working with [John Rolston](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBxTj0IAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [Cory Inman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=y07SI5oAAAAJ). In the lab, **I study intracranial electrophysiology and cognition in patients undergoing neurosurgery using tools from cognitive and computational neuroscience**. This unique approach allows us to study dynamic processes in the brain at the level of single neurons and distributed networks. Our research helps us to better understand how information is processed in the brain, how neuromodulation changes the way the brain is wired, and how we can leverage these insights to better treat patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.
