Welcome! I'm an MD/PhD Student at the University of Utah School of Medicine. Lately, I've been working on a PhD in Neuroscience with [John Rolston](https://www.rolstonlab.com) and [Cory Inman](http://inman-lab.com/) within the [Department of Neurosurgery](https://medicine.utah.edu/neurosurgery/). In the lab, I study the brain electrophysiology and behavior of patients undergoing neurosurgery using tools from the fields of cognitive and computational neuroscience. Our research helps us to better understand how information is processed and transmitted in the brain, how electrical stimulation changes the brain's wiring, and facilitates the development of neuromodulatory therapies.
